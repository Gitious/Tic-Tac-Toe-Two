# Tic Tac Toe Two

## Overview

Tic Tac Toe Two is a web-based game where players take turns marking a 3x3 grid with either an X or an O. The game has unique rules where after the fourth move, the first mark disappears. Players cannot put a fourth mark in the same spot as their first mark, even if they know it will disappear. The game continues indefinitely until a player makes a mistake or wins.
